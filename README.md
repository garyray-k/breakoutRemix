# Breakout Remix for TopCoder

## Installation

Download and install [Unity3d](https://store.unity.com/products/unity-personal) with version 2018.3
Download/Clone my project from GitHub
Open the project with Unity3D.
Click the "Play" button in the top middle of the GUI.
This should launch the game to be played after it builds.
Unity can also build and target and number of different platforms in the "Build Setting" menu.
Under "Build Settings" you can traget standalone Linux, macOS, or Windows.
Alternatively, you can target WebGL which is what I did to host my game [here](https://www.sharemygame.com/share/3ee0aa42-a455-455c-9137-d4936ac1b217) until April 10, 2019.
Or just use the one I built in the "Builds/BreakoutRemix-Buildv1-WebGL" folder. Open "index.html" using Firefox since the other browsers don't like opening a local WebGL file (atleast on my machine).
